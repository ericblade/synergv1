SynerGV 1

Originally written in 2011 for webOS 3.0.x, and then backported to webOS 2.x and 
1.4.5, and enhanced significantly throughout 2012, and ported to Android, Chrome,
and even an unreleased iOS port, SynerGV is one of the most popular Google
Voice(tm) management apps out there.

SynerGV was originally built as an app to allow SMS text messaging from a tablet,
and has been enhanced to support nearly every function of Google Voice.

There is a re-written SynerGV 2 for webOS 3.0.5, however it is quite webOS 3.0.5
specific, as it uses many features and functions that just plain are not (or were
not at the time) available in other systems.  SynerGV 2 source code will be open
sourced in the near future.

SynerGV 1 was written from the ground up using Javascript and Enyo v1, mostly
via a lot of trial and even more error, and using a ton of other Voice projects
for inspiration and information.

Plans had been made to create a SynerGV 3, which would have been written in
a combination of standard Javascript using Enyo v2, 
as well as platform specific pieces in other languages, such as node.js Javascript, 
Android Java, QML, and others, but lack of time on the author's part has made that
an excruciatingly slow project that may not ever see the light of day.
